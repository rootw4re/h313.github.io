summary: "A student club manager that was badly named"
link: "https://github.com/h313/club-charterhelper"
desc: "In my defense, my naming of it was done in five minutes because I needed a repo name and it sorta stuck. Anyways, this is a MEAN stack application made for my school. It's useful because it allows people to sign up for clubs and leave them easily, and anyone in a club can get a list of everyone else currently signed up. Also supports cool images!"
