    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>My name is Haoda Wang, and I'm an ongoing existential crisis! I think this is where I write about myself and try to impress you but my self esteem is so low I can't even impress myself :/</p>
    <p>Anyways, I've been toying around with web technologies, and so far I've created <a href="/projects">a bunch of nifty web apps</a> with them. So far, I can create stuff using the MEAN stack, am proficient enough in C++, C#, and Java, and am really good at Linux and networking stuff. So hire me as a dev or a sysadmin please. Or both.</p>
    <p>I also try to draw a bit, but the results usually end up a bit subpar. Thus, I use humor to offset <a href="https://sadbadlines.tumblr.com">how bad it is</a>.</p>
    <p>Apparently other people say my writing skill is pretty nice, but <a href="https://h313-rants.tumblr.com">it sounds so bad</a>.</p>
