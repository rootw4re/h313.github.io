    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>My name is Haoda Wang, and I'm an ongoing existential crisis! I think this is where I write about myself and try to impress you...?</p>
    <p>Anyways, I've been toying around with web technologies, and so far I've created <a href="/projects">a bunch of nifty web apps</a> with them. So far, I can create stuff using the MEAN stack, am proficient enough in C++, C#, and Java, and am really good at Linux and networking stuff. I can also kind of use Python (with a lot of Stack Overflow of course).</p>
    <p>I also try to draw a bit, but the results usually end up a bit <a href="https://sadbadlines.tumblr.com">subpar</a>.</p>
    <h3>Stuff I Like</h3>
    <p>Neural networks are pretty cool. I've spent a bit of time learning about those and can use Tensorflow now!</p>
    <p>I'm in love with Linux. I've spent nearly two years learning about using Linux, and can pretty much set up Linux from scratch now.</p>
    <p>I've done a whole lot in web application development, and I've learned to use MongoDB and Redis for databases, Python and NodeJS for backends, and Angular and React for the frontend.</p>
    <p>Thinking up of algorithms to solve problems is fun. As long as there isn't a time limit.</p>
