    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>My name is Haoda Wang, and I'm an ongoing existential crisis! I think this is where I write about myself and try to impress you but my self esteem is so low I can't even impress myself :/</p>
    <p>Anyways, since I have no idea what I want to do, I'm literally trying everything under the sun. So far, I've made quite a few <a href="/projects">programming projects</a>, started a <a href="https://sadbadlines.tumblr.com">rather bad webcomic</a>, and <a href="https://forcemedia.org/news/2017/1/28/2016-and-change">written</a> a lot.</p>
    <p>You probably want to know what I can do. Well, here's a nice list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Computer Stuff
        <ul>
          <li>Really good at Linux</li>
          <li>Can do C#, C++, NodeJS</li>
          <li>Can do network security stuff and sysadmin stuff</li>
          <li>Good at MEAN stack</li>
          <li>Can Use Illustrator</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Not Computer Stuff
        <ul>
          <li>Can use a longsword. Not really useful, to be honest</li>
          <li>Can make jokes. Like, really good ones.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
