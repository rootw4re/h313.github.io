  <h1>Hello! Welcome to my corner of the Internet!</h1>
  <br>
  <p>My name is Haoda Wang, and I'm a... yeah. I like lots of things, including food. Especially food. I believe the concept of a navbar is clear to you, and its a great way to use my website (kinda the only way heh)!</p>
  <p>So I like lots of stuff. I kind of like music I guess... umm trying to be a comic artist, but my drawings are weird... I think neural networks are really cool, but who doesn't?</p>
  <p>By the way, the only reason I'm using Bootstrap is because I'm too lazy to use Skeleton and Materialize is really fat.</p>
