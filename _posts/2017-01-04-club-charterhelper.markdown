In my defense, my naming of it was done in five minutes because I needed a repo
name and it sorta stuck. Anyways, this is a MEAN stack application made for my
school. It's useful because it allows people to sign up for clubs and leave them
easily, and anyone in a club can get a list of everyone else currently signed up.
Also supports cool images!
