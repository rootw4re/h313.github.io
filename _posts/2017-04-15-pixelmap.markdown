[/r/place][place] was Reddit's 2017 April Fool's Day experiment, where each user was allowed to place one pixel onto a map containing 1 million pixels.

[This][pixelmap] repo contains a backend for a 1000x1000 grid /r/place clone. This backend was written with Redis and Flask. It uses the MAC address as authentication.
