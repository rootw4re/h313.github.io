Markov Chains are great. They allow you to create a something new that sorta
makes sense from some original source material. So, I went ahead and made my own
two Markov Chains!

* [Shakespeare's Dreams][dreams], based off of Shakespeare's
*Macbeth*
* [Karl Markov][karl], based off of Marx's *Communist Manifesto*
